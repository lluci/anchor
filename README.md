# Anchor — Technical Overview

This document defines the conceptual and functional model of Anchor, a habit-rhythm system based on temporal windows, weekly planning, and low-friction daily interaction. It includes system behavior, state models, notification logic, and core rules for data integrity and adaptation.

# 1. System Purpose

Anchor provides an external rhythm for daily habits, reducing time-loss caused by hyperfocus and improving consistency through structured temporal windows.
The system prioritizes:
	•	minimal daily interaction,
	•	strong weekly planning,
	•	qualitative time modeling (windows, not timestamps),
	•	non-judgmental feedback,
	•	predictable, low-friction behavior.
