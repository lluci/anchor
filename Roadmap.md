# Anchor — Roadmap

## Milestone v1.0 — Core App (Complete, No Notifications)

Includes everything defined in the initial design:
	•	Daily habit panel
	•	Semaphor time windows + proportional timeline
	•	Hour ruler
	•	Done / Edit Window / Skip
	•	Four skip-reason categories
	•	Full persistence (daily state, edits, skips)
	•	Daily Plan
	•	Weekly Plan + Special Days
	•	Mode switching (Normal / Special)

Intention: Deliver the complete Anchor interaction model, fully functional and persistent, without time-based automation.

## Milestone v1.1 — Notification Engine

Add the temporal layer on top of the existing logic:
	•	Window-based notifications
	•	Tone and escalation rules
	•	Snooze mechanism
	•	View of upcoming triggers

Intention: Make Anchor proactive, not just reflective, while keeping the interaction minimal and intentional.

## Future Directions (Not Milestones Yet)
	•	Trend / Energy indicator
	•	Extended analytics
	•	Optional long-term insights
