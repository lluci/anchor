# Anchor — Roadmap

## Milestone v1.0 — Core App (Complete, No Notifications)

Includes everything defined in the initial design:
	•	Daily habit panel
	•	Semaphor time windows + proportional timeline
	•	Hour ruler
	•	Done / Edit Window / Skip
	•	Four skip-reason categories
	•	Full persistence (daily state, edits, skips)
	•	Daily Plan
	•	Weekly Plan + Special Days
	•	Mode switching (Normal / Special)

Intention: Deliver the complete Anchor interaction model, fully functional and persistent, without time-based automation.

## Milestone v1.1 — Notification Engine

Add the temporal layer on top of the existing logic:
	•	Window-based notifications
	•	Tone and escalation rules
	•	Snooze mechanism
	•	View of upcoming triggers

Intention: Make Anchor proactive, not just reflective, while keeping the interaction minimal and intentional.

## Future Directions (Not Milestones Yet)
    •	Daily levels of burnout and management of the energy
	•	Trend of energy in the header
	•	Extended analytics in settings popup
	•	Long-term insights
    •	Add dark mode
    •	Add mobile support

## Pending fixes & tech debt
    •	Special mode Omit: add "Why?" field, like regular omits.
    •	Normal mode: Editar button don't change color of the badge when clicked. (the issue happen only on the first card).
